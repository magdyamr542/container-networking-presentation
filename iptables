    - Configure the kernel's netlifier firewall
    - Configure NAT rules on linux
    - Tables
        - a table is a list of chains
    - Chains
        - list of rules
        - e.g, PREROUTING, INPUT, FORWARD, OUTPUT, POSTROUTING 
        - DANT and MASQUERADE
        - PREROUTING is used for packets arriving from outside
        - OUTPUT is used for packets originating from this server
    - Targets
        - The target/jump tells the rule what to do with a packet that is matched with the match section of the rule
        - There are a couple of basic targets, the ACCEPT and DROP targets

        - MASQUERADE (like SNAT but for dynamic ips)
            - valid in the POSTROUTING chain
            - used to modify the src ip address of packets
            -  when a packet matches a rule with the MASQUERADE target, the src IP address of that packet 
                is replaced with the IP address of the outbound interface through which the packet is leaving 
                the network.
            - commonly used where a network wants to share a single public IP address among multiple internal devices 
                while hiding their individual IP addresses 
            - uses --to-ports <port>
            - uses --to <ip>:<port>

        - DNAT
            - valid in the PREROUTING chain
            - used to modify the dst ip address of packets
            - uses --to-destination <ip>:<port>
            - Example for port mapping

    - Commands
        - Check nat table: "sudo iptables -t nat -L -n -v"
