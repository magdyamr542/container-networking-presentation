Network interfaces:
    - Software to control the networking hardware
    - eth0 to control an ethernet device
    - wlan0 is the wireless interface
    - lo is the loopback interface (virtual interface, not backed by a hardware device)
    - Create an interface and bring it up "ifconfig eth0 192.168.2.1 netmask 255.255.255.0 up"
