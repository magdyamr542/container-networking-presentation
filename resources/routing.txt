Routing:
    - The dummy interface https://tldp.org/LDP/nag/node72.html
    - Routing tables and routing decisions 
    - routing tables decide how traffic is routed
    - used for packet forwarding
    - use "ip route"

List the network interfaces
    "ip link show"

List the ip addresses
    "ip addr show"

Create a new dummy interface eth1
    "sudo ip link add eth1 type dummy"

Add an ip to that interface 
    "sudo ip addr add 172.20.0.1/16 dev eth1"

Activate the interface
    "sudo ip link set eth1 up"

Show routing decisions for a certain ip
    "ip route get 172.20.0.15"

Listen to connections on that interface
    "python3 -m http.server --bind 172.20.0.1 1234"

Make requests
    "curl 172.20.0.1:1234"

Clean up
     "sudo ip link delete eth1 type dummy"  # routes will be deleted automatically
