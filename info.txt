Networking:

Videos
    - container networking https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6v_BDHIgOY8
        - namespace
            - different networking stack
            - different interfaces, ip tables rules, ip routing rules
            - check with ifconfig

        - prepare examples
            - 1 node, 1 namespae, connect between root ns and created ns
            - 1 node, 2 namespaes, connect between both nss using a virtual bridge
            - 2 nodes, in the same L2 network

Network interfaces:
    - Software to control the networking hardware
    - eth0 to control an ethernet device
    - wlan0 is the wireless interface
    - lo is the loopback interface (virtual interface, not backed by a hardware device)
    - Create an interface and bring it up "ifconfig eth0 192.168.2.1 netmask 255.255.255.0 up"

Presentation structure:
    1. General networking
        - Network interfaces
            - Explain interfaces
            - Show the usage with the command ifconfig
        - Routing tables (./routing)
            - Explain the routing tables
            - Show the current routes
            - Example
                - Add a new network interface, give it an ip
                - Listen on that ip
                - Configure the routing table
                - Do a ping
        - Iptables (./iptables)
            - Explain tables, chains and targets
            - Example
                - Show port forwarding (./examples/port_forwarding)
                - process running on port 8080
                - requests to port 80 are forwarded to 8080
                - use the PREROUTING rule with REDIRECT
        - Namespaces (./namespaces)
            - Explain network namespaces
            - Example 1
                - Create ns1 and try to access internet, doesn't work
                - Add a veth pair to ns1
                - Now access the internet
            - Example 2
                - Create ns1 and ns2
                - Setup communication between them through a virtual bridge
